# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion card

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge. Played a bit with pseudo elements and animations. Learned that pseudo elements are useful for adding things like SVGs but if you want to use eventlisteners to trigger them I could not find a way to target them. Just touched the tip of animations and what I did in the project is pretty much an example in MDN documentation. Understand that the transform property is going to be the thing that is played with the most for maunipulating the object. Translate X&Y are how the movement is taking place. Keyframes help you break down the series of events. Should be fun to explore this more in depth.
